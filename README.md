# UFO-Challenge: A Web-page to display, filter, and engage with data on UFO sightings.


## Overview of Project: 
In this analysis, we created a table to organize and summarize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array. We began by exploring JavaScript, built and deployed JavaScript functions (including built-in functions), converted JavaScript function to arrow functions, utilized forEach loops, and populated an HTML page.


## Results: 
The primary function of the website is to allow individuals to filter UFO sighting details by date, city, state, county, or shape of the observed UFO. To utilize the site, simply populate one or more of the filters. Below, an image of filtered for sightings across the U.S. on 1/5/2010:

## Summary: 
One of the main drawbacks about this dataset is that it is stored locally and cannot be shared with the wider community unless it is re-downloaded. This could be improved by hosting the web-page on a public server and pulling data from an API of UFO sightings. Additionally, it would be helpful to visualize interactive bar, pie, or other charts which illustrate the dates and places where the most UFOs were spotted.
